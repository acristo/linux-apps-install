# linux-apps-install
list of software I need to install in my linux computers

With this repository i'll try to both learn how to use github as long as keeping a safe copy of how to deploy a new version of the software I need in my new computer. This will help me save time when I change computer.

I'm trying also to learn how to share code with students, both, in a public and in a private way
